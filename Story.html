	<h2><b>MiHoYo's Story</b></h2>
	</div>
</div>
<p class="b">Today, MiHoYo has truly become a well-known company in the game industry, with many supporters and many opponents, but as its development process, it is actually not known or heard by people, but Incomplete.</p>
<p class="c">The MiHoYo team was officially established in Shanghai in 2011. The initial developers of the entire team were students from the Computer Science Department of Shanghai Jiaotong University. Because of their love for the animation "Evangelion", and to pay tribute to it, the miHoYo team launched during their college career. The first mobile game they made - "FlyMe2theMoon"</p>

<p class="b">Since then, MiHoYo has continued to develop and has successively launched a number of high-quality popular products, including "Honkai Gakuen 2", "Honkai 3", "Undecided Event Book", "Genshin Impact", and the dynamic desktop software "Artificial Desktop". And the community product "Miyoushe".</p>

</div>
<p class="c">MiHoYo is unlike any game company in China. Because they are desperately playing games. In order to make Genshin Impact, MiHoYo did not launch any games for 4 years from 2016 to 2020. Only $250 million in revenue in 2019, but supported 1,400 employees. Almost all the money earned is used to make Genshin Impact.</p>
<p class="b">MiHoYo is often questioned because it borrows too much from well-known games and even has a history of plagiarism. But it has to be said that it is the only company among all the well-known game companies in China that is dedicated to making games and is willing to use all the revenue to continue to develop new games.</p>
<p class="c">Although the means they used are not completely good, MiHoYo has indeed rapidly developed to the head of the global mobile game. Believe that someday it will create a virtual world. Like that sentence.</p>
