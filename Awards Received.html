	<p>In December 2021, The Game Awards 2021 (TGA 2021 for short) ceremony officially opened.
	 The "Genshin Impact", which has been on fire for a year, did not accompany it this time, 
	 but won the "Best Mobile Game of TGA 2021" award as it wished. Just last week, it just won
	 the Sony PlayStation Partner Awards as the "first person in China".</p>


	<p>In the 2020 TGA Awards nominations, Genshin Impact was nominated for Best Mobile Game and 
    Best RPG Game, but unfortunately, Final Fantasy 7: Remake by Square Enix finally won the Best 
    RPG Game. Award, and "Among us" won the best mobile game award, Genshin regret not won the award. 
    Fortunately, in 2021, regrets will be made up.</p>
